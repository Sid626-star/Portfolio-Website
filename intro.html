                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a final-year student pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science from Galgotias College of
                    Engineering and Technology,Greater Noida,Uttar pradesh,India.Throughout my academic journey, I
                    have acquired proficiency in a diverse set of programming languages and technologies, including
                    Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React. Additionally, I have honed my abilities through
                    practical application, having completed a comprehensive course on Java Full Stack Development
                    with Wipro and another on Python with Infosys. These experiences have equipped me with a solid
                    foundation in both front-end and back-end development, enabling me to tackle complex challenges
                    with confidence.
                    <br></br>
                    I am particularly proud of my recent projects, which showcase my capabilities in building
                    real-world applications. One such project is a Spotify clone, where I leveraged my knowledge of
                    front-end technologies to replicate the user interface and functionality of the popular music
                    streaming platform. Additionally, I developed a React application named TodosList, which
                    demonstrates my ability to create intuitive and efficient user interfaces while seamlessly
                    integrating with backend systems.I am eager to contribute my skills and passion for software
                    development to your team, collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of technology and
                    drive meaningful impact.
