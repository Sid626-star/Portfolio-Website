                    <h3>College Details</h3>
                    <p>I am currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Galgotias College Of Engineering And Technology,Greater Noida.My current CGPA is 7.1.I am in my final year of college and during these 4 years I learnt of new technologies and languages like Java,Javascript,HTML,CSS,MERN and had also done course on Java Full Stack Development from Wipro and on python from Infosys.These experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development, enabling me to tackle complex challenges with confidence.I am particularly proud of my recent projects, which showcase my capabilities in building real-world applications. One such project is a Spotify clone, where I leveraged my knowledge of front-end technologies to replicate the user interface and functionality of the popular music streaming platform. Additionally, I developed a React application named TodosList, which demonstrates my ability to create intuitive and efficient user interfaces while seamlessly integrating with backend systems.</p>
